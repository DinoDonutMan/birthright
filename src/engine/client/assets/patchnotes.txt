[TITLE]Beginning of real development
[SUBTITLE]Patch notes test 02
[TEXT]January 9th marks the day I did swapped some free assets in for the rectangles and wrote some
netcode so that a few friends and I could all move around on the same website. This was the day

[TITLE]The first bit of code I wrote for this game
[SUBTITLE]Patch notes test 01
[TEXT]January 2nd, 2025. The first time I coded a single rectangle in canvas that I could
move around with arrow keys. I messed around with this code on the 2nd and 3rd, and then canned 
the project until the 9th.
